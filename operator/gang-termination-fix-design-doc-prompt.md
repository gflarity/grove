## Motivation



The MNNVL support feature in Grove is guided by three core design principles:



**Simplicity:** Currently, Kubernetes workloads can take advantage of NVIDIA MNNVL accelerated hardware by explicitly adding NVIDIA ComputeDomain APIs to their workloads. With this feature, when applicable, Grove will abstract the MNNVL hardware from users by automatically creating ComputeDomain custom resources, enabling ComputeDomains support to workloads, and managing the lifecycle of the CRs.



Power users who require custom ComputeDomain or RCT configurations can opt-out of automatic MNNVL management and specify their own `resourceClaims` directly in the pod spec template.



**Portability:** The Grove Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs)—specifically PodCliqueSet, PodCliqueScalingGroup, and PodClique—are designed to be generic, excluding any direct references to MNNVL, ComputeDomain, or other NVIDIA-specific components.



To maintain portability, all MNNVL-related configuration is kept external, residing in the operator configuration and runtime annotations. This approach allows the same PodCliqueSet manifest to be used without alteration, regardless of whether the target cluster supports MNNVL.



**Standard Kubernetes behavior:** ComputeDomain lifecycle follows the same reconciliation pattern as other Grove-managed resources. If CD creation fails (due to transient cluster issues), the sync stops and requeues for retry. Persistent failures are surfaced via Kubernetes Events, allowing cluster administrators to investigate.



## Background



### What is MNNVL?



**MNNVL (Multi-Node NVLink)** is an NVIDIA technology that extends NVLink-class, high-bandwidth GPU-to-GPU communication across **multiple physical nodes**, rather than being limited to GPUs within a single server. It uses specialized hardware and software mechanisms (such as IMEX for secure memory export/import) to allow GPUs on different nodes to access each other’s memory with much lower latency and higher bandwidth than traditional network-based approaches like TCP or even standard RDMA. In Kubernetes, MNNVL is exposed through NVIDIA’s DRA driver so distributed workloads (for example, large-scale training or tightly coupled inference) can treat GPUs across nodes as part of a single, high-performance compute fabric while preserving isolation and security between workloads.



### Using MNNVL in a K8S cluster



To use **MNNVL (Multi-Node NVLink)** in Kubernetes with NVIDIA’s DRA driver, you start by creating a **ComputeDomain (CD)**. The ComputeDomain represents a logical GPU fabric spanning multiple nodes and defines how inter-node NVLink/IMEX channels are allocated. the `ComputeDomainSpec.Channel` references a `ResourceClaimTemplate`; this template describes the DRA resource class (MNNVL) that will be used to provision the interconnect. When the ComputeDomain is created, the NVIDIA DRA controller prepares the underlying GPU fabric and ensures that nodes participating in the domain can securely communicate over MNNVL.



Next, pods that want to use MNNVL simply **reference the ResourceClaimTemplate** in their pod spec. Each pod declares a `resourceClaims` entry pointing to the template name, and the container lists that claim under `resources.claims`. Kubernetes then automatically creates a **ResourceClaim per pod** from the template. These per-pod claims are handed to the NVIDIA DRA driver, which allocates the necessary MNNVL/IMEX channels for each pod within the ComputeDomain.



As a result, multiple pods—possibly scheduled on different nodes—are joined into the same ComputeDomain and can communicate using **multi-node NVLink semantics** without manually wiring GPUs or fabric resources. The ComputeDomain handles reachability and isolation, the ResourceClaimTemplate enables automatic per-pod allocation, and the pod spec remains simple: create a `ComputeDomain` once, then reference its template in every pod that needs MNNVL.



#### ComputeDomain Status Lifecycle



When a `CD` is first created, it exists without an operational status—it is neither ready nor failed at this point. The `CD` only becomes active once pods referencing its `RCT` are scheduled. At that point, the NVIDIA DRA driver deploys a `DaemonSet` on the nodes where those pods are scheduled to establish the MNNVL fabric. The `CD`'s status is then derived from the aggregate health of these DaemonSet pods: if all pods are healthy, the `CD` reports as ready; otherwise, it reflects a degraded or failed state.



# Goals



The following key goals, derived from the requirements document, guide the MNNVL design:

* **Homogeneous Cluster Support:** The feature will only support clusters with the exact same type of GPUs on all nodes. (AKA homogeneous cluster)

  * Grove does not validate or enforce cluster homogeneity—it is the cluster admin's responsibility to enable this feature only on clusters that meet this requirement. Enabling MNNVL on heterogeneous clusters may result in undefined scheduling behavior.

* **Global Configuration:** A global configuration for the feature is required. If the cluster does not support MNNVL, the Grove Operator will exit with a non-zero exit code.

* **Opt-Out***

  * An immutable, granular-level opt-out option must be available in the PCS.

* **Workload Impact:**

  * Enabling/Disabling of MNNVL feature should not impact a currently running workload.

* **ComputeDomain Management:**

  * Each PCS replica must have its own dedicated ComputeDomain.

  * The lifecycle of the ComputeDomain is tied directly to the lifecycle of the PCS replica.



## Scope and Limitations



This document covers **Phase 1** of MNNVL support in Grove. See GREP-270 for the full requirements.



**Limitations:**



- **Homogeneous Clusters Only:** This phase supports only homogeneous clusters where all nodes have identical GPU types and NVLink topology. Grove does not validate or enforce cluster homogeneity—it is the cluster administrator's responsibility to enable this feature only on clusters that meet this requirement. Enabling MNNVL on heterogeneous clusters may result in undefined scheduling behavior.



- **PCS-Level Granularity:** The MNNVL feature is applied at the PCS level—it cannot be targeted to individual PCs or PCSGs within a PCS. Either all pods in a replica receive the RCT reference, or none do.



- **No ComputeDomain Customization:** The ComputeDomain and ResourceClaimTemplate configurations are automatically generated by Grove and cannot be customized. Power users who require custom configurations can opt-out of automatic MNNVL management and specify their own `resourceClaims` directly in the pod spec template.



# Design Details



## Enabling the feature



Enabling and disabling the feature will be done by the cluster admin by setting a flag in the Grove OperatorConfiguration.



```go

// MNNVLConfiguration defines the configuration for MNNVL (Multi-Node NVLink) support.

type MNNVLConfiguration struct {

   // Enabled indicates whether MNNVL support is enabled.

   // When true, the operator validates that the ComputeDomain CRD is installed at startup.

   // When MNNVL support is enabled, cluster admin should ensure that the ComputeDomain CRD has been installed.

   // If this prerequisite fails then Grove will exit with a non-zero exit code.

   Enabled bool `json:"enabled"`

}

```



The value could be set from a Helm chart under the config attribute



```yaml

config:

	mnnvl:

		enabled: false

```



> **Note:** Using the `OperatorConfiguration` for feature enablement is chosen for simplicity in Phase 1. However, a plugin-based approach would provide better decoupling between the MNNVL feature and Grove core, and should be considered for future phases.



### Feature validity 



When the Grove operator starts, it will check for MNNVL support (only if the feature is enabled). Support is confirmed by the presence of the ComputeDomain CRD in the cluster.



If the cluster lacks MNNVL support, the Grove operator will terminate and log an appropriate error.



## ComputeDomain lifecycle management



### Creation



The PCS controller has a reconciliation flow for managing resources in a specific order. The `ComputeDomain` component is synced **before** creating PCs and PCSGs, ensuring the CD exists before pods that reference it are created.



Before creating the `CD`, the controller checks the following criteria:



1. The MNNVL feature is enabled in Grove's `OperatorConfiguration`.

2. The PCS has not opted out via the `grove.io/mnnvl-enabled: "false"` annotation.

3. At least one PC in the PCS requires a GPU.



If all criteria are met, the controller creates a `ComputeDomain` resource for each PCS replica. The CD is named `{pcs-name}-cd-{replica-index}` and references an RCT named `{pcs-name}-rct-{replica-index}`. The PCS is set as the owner reference to enable automatic garbage collection.



```yaml

apiVersion: resource.nvidia.com/v1beta1

kind: ComputeDomain

metadata:

  name: my-pcs-cd-0

  labels:

    grove.io/podcliqueset: my-pcs

    grove.io/replica-index: "0"

  ownerReferences:

    - apiVersion: grove.io/v1alpha1

      kind: PodCliqueSet

      name: my-pcs

      controller: true

spec:

  channel:

    resourceClaimTemplateName: my-pcs-rct-0

```



### Observability



ComputeDomain creation follows the same observability pattern as other Grove-managed resources:



- **Kubernetes Events:** Success and failure events are emitted on the PCS resource.

  ```

  kubectl describe pcs my-pcs

  # Events:

  #   Normal   ComputeDomainCreated   ComputeDomain my-pcs-cd-0 created

  #   Warning  ComputeDomainFailed    Failed to create ComputeDomain for replica 2: <error>

  ```



- **Logs:** Detailed error information is logged by the operator.



- **Requeue on failure:** If CD creation fails, the sync stops and requeues for retry. PC and PCSG creation only proceeds after all CDs for the replicas have been successfully created.



### Watching the compute domain



To ensure the PCS controller reconciles when a `ComputeDomain` is deleted, a watch must be added in the PCS controller's RegisterWithManager function. 



When the controller creates a `ComputeDomain` resource, it should attach the label `grove.io/podcliqueset` with the value `<pcs-name>` to identify which PCS owns it. 

```yaml

apiVersion: v1beta1

kind: ComputeDomain

metadata:

 labels:

   grove.io/podcliqueset: <pcs-name>

```



As part of the registration process, a new watch will added to enqueue events for `ComputeDomain` created by the controller (using the `grove.io/podcliqueset`label as a filter).



### Scale-Out and Scale-In



When scaling out (replicas increased), the subsequent reconciliation process will identify the ComputeDomains missing for the new replica indices and create them using the identical logic as the initial creation.



When scaling in (replicas decreased), the PCS controller determines which `ComputeDomains` to delete by comparing the existing ones against the new replica count. Any `ComputeDomain` with a replica index equal to or greater than the new count is removed. This process mirrors the "desired versus existing" logic used for managing `PodClique` and `PCSG`.



The controller lists existing `ComputeDomains` by label selector, computes expected resources from the current spec, and deletes the excess.



### PCS Deletion  

When a PodCliqueSet is deleted, all ComputeDomain resources are automatically garbage-collected by Kubernetes through the owner reference mechanism. 



Since each ComputeDomain has controllerReference set to the PCS, Kubernetes will cascade-delete them when the PCS is removed. No explicit cleanup logic is required in the controller for this case.



## PCS opt-out



Users can opt-out of MNNVL support for a specific `PodCliqueSet` using the `grove.io/mnnvl-enabled` annotation. 



When the global MNNVL feature is enabled in the `OperatorConfiguration`, individual workloads inherit this setting by default. To disable MNNVL for a specific PCS, set the annotation to "`false`".  



When opting out, the operator will not create a `ComputeDomain` for that PCS.



This annotation is validated as immutable by the PCS validation webhook, meaning that once a PCS is created with or without the annotation, it cannot be changed or removed. This ensures consistent behavior throughout the lifecycle of the workload.



## PC and PCSG Creation



When the PCS controller creates a PC or PCSG for a replica, it checks whether a CD exists for that replica. If a CD exists, the controller adds an annotation to the PC/PCSG with the RCT name:



**Annotation:**

- **Key:** `grove.io/compute-domain-rct`

- **Value:** The RCT name for the replica (e.g., `my-pcs-rct-0`)



If no CD exists for the replica (feature disabled or PCS opted out), the annotation is not added.



```yaml

apiVersion: grove.io/v1alpha1

kind: PodClique

metadata:

  name: my-pcs-0-worker

  annotations:

    grove.io/compute-domain-rct: "my-pcs-rct-0"  # Present only if CD exists

  labels:

    grove.io/podcliqueset: my-pcs

    grove.io/replica-index: "0"

```



```yaml

apiVersion: grove.io/v1alpha1

kind: PodCliqueScalingGroup

metadata:

  name: my-pcs-0-scaling

  annotations:

    grove.io/compute-domain-rct: "my-pcs-rct-0"  # Present only if CD exists

  labels:

    grove.io/podcliqueset: my-pcs

    grove.io/replica-index: "0"

```



When a PCSG creates PCs, it propagates the `grove.io/compute-domain-rct` annotation to its child PCs.



### Why Use an Annotation?



A simpler approach would be to have the Pod controller check if the MNNVL support is required at pod creation time and decide whether to add the RCT reference dynamically. However, this approach has a critical flaw:



**Problem: Inconsistent pods within a PC**



Consider this scenario:

1. MNNVL feature is **disabled** → PCS created → no CD created

2. Pods are created **without** `resourceClaims`

3. Admin **enables** the feature globally

4. Something triggers PCS reconciliation → CD is now created

5. A pod crashes and gets recreated

6. New pod is created **with** `resourceClaims` (CD now exists)



**Result:** Within the same PC, some pods have RCT references and some don't—breaking the consistency guarantee.



**Solution: Point-in-time decision via annotation**



By recording the RCT name as an annotation at PC creation time:

- The decision is made **once** when the PC is created

- All pods in that PC use the **same** configuration

- Feature enable/disable after PC creation does **not** affect existing PCs

- Consistency is guaranteed for the lifetime of the PC



This aligns with the goal: *"Enabling/Disabling of MNNVL feature should not impact a currently running workload."*



## Pod Reconciliation



When the PC controller reconciles pods, the Pod component checks its parent PC for the `grove.io/compute-domain-rct` annotation:



- **If the annotation exists:** The Pod is created with a `resourceClaims` entry referencing the RCT name from the annotation.

- **If the annotation is absent:** The Pod is created without an RCT reference.



Since the annotation is set at PC creation time and is immutable, all pods within a PC have a consistent configuration throughout their lifecycle.



```yaml

apiVersion: v1

kind: Pod

metadata:

  name: my-pcs-0-worker-pod-0

  labels:

    grove.io/podcliqueset: my-pcs

    grove.io/podclique: my-pcs-0-worker

spec:

  resourceClaims:

    - name: mnnvl-claim

      resourceClaimTemplateName: my-pcs-rct-0  # From PC annotation

  containers:

    - name: inference

      image: my-inference-image

      resources:

        claims:

          - name: mnnvl-claim

```



If the PC does not have the `grove.io/compute-domain-rct` annotation, the pod is created without the `resourceClaims` section.```.  @gang-termination-refactoring-plan.md. 



Please create a new design document to reflect the changes made in @gang-termination-refactoring-plan.md. The motivations come from fixing this bug which is the result of excluding unscheduled pods from the breach calculations: 


```
What happened?
The newly created E2E tests are failing for gang termination. The root cause is that the E2E tests use cordoning nodes and killing pods afterwards to creates breaches. Currently when podclique status is reconciled, we avoid breaching if scheduledReplicas < minAvailable. So the test cases don't actually trigger a breach as intended:

// If the number of scheduled pods is less than the minimum available, then minAvailable is not considered as breached.
 // Consider a case where none of the PodCliques have been scheduled yet, then it should not cause the PodGang to be recreated all the time.
 if scheduledReplicas < minAvailable {
  return metav1.Condition{
   Type:               constants.ConditionTypeMinAvailableBreached,
   Status:             metav1.ConditionFalse,
   Reason:             constants.ConditionReasonInsufficientScheduledPods,
   Message:            fmt.Sprintf("Insufficient scheduled pods. expected at least: %d, found: %d", minAvailable, scheduledReplicas),
   LastTransitionTime: now,
  }
 }
This also happens inside the PCSG status reconciliation as well:

 if scheduledReplicas < minAvailable {
  return metav1.Condition{
   Type:    constants.ConditionTypeMinAvailableBreached,
   Status:  metav1.ConditionFalse,
   Reason:  constants.ConditionReasonInsufficientScheduledPCSGReplicas,
   Message: fmt.Sprintf("Insufficient scheduled replicas. expected at least: %d, found: %d", minAvailable, scheduledReplicas),
  }
 }
I tried to a couple of "easy" fixes just to see. They didn't work for various reasons but maybe someone else has the needed context.
```


Other motivations are based on the discussions with stake holders, including SREs who are actively managing AI instructure and workloads. Based on these discussions we decided to keep thing as simple as possible while ensuring that initial startup of podcliqueset replicas don’t get gang terminated. Only after these workloads degrade after starting up successfully do we terminate them after the delay.
